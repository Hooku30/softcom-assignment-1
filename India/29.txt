Paragraph: 
KOLKATA: Taking exception to PM Modiâs âsilenceâ on Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee being greeted with chants of âJai Shri
Ramâ at Saturdayâs official Netaji birth anniversary event in Kolkata, Trinamool Congress on Sunday termed the conduct of a
section of the audience âmisogynisticâ and an affront to what Subhas Chandra Bose stood for. âPM Modi did not utter a single
word to condemn the behaviour of a section of the audience...This shows BJP has no respect for Netaji and has no idea of what he
stood for,â minister Bratya Basu said. He accused BJP of trying to promote âa certain concept of Lord Ramâ in Bengal.
âBengalâs concept of Ram, which we have grown up with, entails respect for women. Those who used Sri Ramâs name in their
slogans at Victoria (Memorial) neither respect Ram nor women.â Trinamool MP Abhishek Banerjee said, âMamata Banerjee is a CM
elected by 2.5 crore people in Bengal. By not allowing her to speak, she was insulted.â Mamata had been invited to speak at the
event in Victoria Memorial ahead of the PM, but she returned to her seat the moment some in the crowd uttered âJai Shri Ramâ.
Trinamool spokesperson Kunal Ghosh said, âThis wasnât a political programme. This was a government programme. Their
understanding of what should be said where, is slightly less.â Many among the bevy of celebrities who attended the event,
including some who have been critical of TMC, said they loved everything about the event other than the row over âJai Shri
Ramâ. Responding to the outrage, BJP demanded to know if Mamataâs refusal to speak at the event amid chants of âJai Shri
Ramâ was a political stance or not. Netajiâs grandnephew Chandra Kumar Bose, who had contested the South Kolkata Lok Sabha
seat on a BJP ticket, criticised the CM over her reaction to the chant.
