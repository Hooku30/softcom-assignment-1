Paragraph: 
NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday urged NCC cadets and NSS volunteers to help disseminate the right information on
vaccines to the poor and general public. He said after Indian scientists have done their duty by developing the Covid-19 vaccine,
now there is a need to fulfil the responsibility of defeating the disease by countering lies and rumours. Addressing NCC cadets,
NSS volunteers and artists who would be participating in the Republic Day parade, Modi said, âIn Covid times also, the work done
by you is laudable. When the government and administration needed it, you came forward as volunteers and provided help. Whether it
was spreading awareness about the Aarogya Setu App or coronavirus infection spread, the work done by you was praiseworthy.â The
PM urged the youths to come forward to help the country with the Covid-19 vaccination programme. âYou have to provide the right
information on vaccines to the poor and general public,â he said. Modi also said India will not become self-reliant just by
somebody saying so, but this will be achieved by actions of the youth for which they have to be armed with necessary skills. He
urged the youth to observe what all foreign made items they use everyday and how many are Made in India products. The PM said
India will become Atmanirbhar when everyone does the needful. Stating that many foreign-made items have invaded our lives, the PM
said, âWe donât know we have become mentally slave. I urge the NCC cadets and NSS volunteers to make a list of the items that
we use are not Made in India and you will realise how much loss we have caused to ourselves,â Modi said as he urged them to be
more âvocal about localâ.
