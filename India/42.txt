Paragraph: 
THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Keralaâs LDF government has referred to the CBI sexual harassment cases filed against five Congress leaders,
including former chief minister Oommen Chandy and AICC general secretary K C Venugopal, and BJP national vice-president A P
Abdullakutty, based on complaints from the prime accused in the solar scam. The decision to transfer the cases registered by the
crime branch 27 months ago was taken in the cabinet meeting last week and notified as an extraordinary gazette on Saturday. The
order notified six crime cases registered by the crime branch CID in 2018 and conveyed consent under Section 6 of the Delhi
Special Police Establishment Act so that the CBI can probe these cases in the state. The state government had, in the first week
of November last year, withdrawn general consent for a CBI probe in the state. The CBI can probe only those cases referred by the
government or ordered by the courts in the state now. Besides Chandy, Venugopal and Adullakutty, the cases referred are those
against MPs Adoor Prakash and Hibi Eden, and former minister and MLA A P Anilkumar. Though the complainant had levelled harassment
allegations against 10 more leaders, including former MP and new LDF ally Jose K Mani, the crime branch hasnât registered FIRs
against them. The detailed statements of the complainant have been recorded only in these six cases. Welcoming the CBI probe, the
complainant said she stood by her allegations against all leaders, including Jose K Mani, and hoped that the CBI would nail the
culprits.
