Paragraph: 
TAIPEI: Chinese air force planes including 12 fighter jets entered Taiwanâs air defence identification zone for a second day on
Sunday, Taiwan said, as tensions rise near the island just days into US President Joe Bidenâs new administration. China views
democratically ruled Taiwan as its own territory, and has in the past few months increased military activity near the island. But
Chinaâs activities over the weekend mark a ratcheting up with fighters and bombers being dispatched rather than reconnaissance
aircraft as had generally been the case in recent weeks. After eight Chinese bomber planes and four fighter jets flew into
Taiwanâs defence zone on Saturday, between mainland Taiwan and the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands in the South China Sea, a
further 15 flew into the same air space on Sunday, Taiwan said. The defence ministry said Taiwanâs air force was sent up to
respond. China has yet to comment. It has previously said such actions are aimed at defending the countryâs sovereignty and
designed to act as a warning against âcollusionâ between the US and Taiwan. The move is likely to further concern Washington,
which on Saturday urged China to stop pressuring Taiwan and reaffirmed its commitment to the island and desire to deepen ties.
